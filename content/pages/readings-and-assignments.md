Students should complete the assigned readings before class and be prepared for meaningful discussion. For the first four weeks students will be guided by specific questions. Students will be asked to prepare the presentation and discussion of the original research articles they have read. Assigned readings are from the course textbook:

On a schematic helix, label the rise per residue, helical pitch and residues / turn for Pauling / Corey alpha helices. Use the values from the paper or from B&T.{{< br >}}2.  The Beta-alpha-beta motif that is common in globular proteins can be left-handed or right handed. Do they occur with equal frequency in proteins of known structure?{{< br >}}3.  Drawing on your undergraduate or graduate biochemistry draw the pathways for the reduction and oxidation of a pair of peptidyl cysteines capable of forming an S-S bond, with a) DTT as the redox agent, and b) Mercaptoethanol.{{< br >}}4.  Anfinsen et al present and discuss a series of possible models for the refolding pathways followed by the RNase chains refolding in vitro in their experiments. Summarize briefly their A1, A2, A3 & A4 models and their rationales for rejecting models A1, A2 and A3 on the basis of the Figure 1 data. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  | Assignment 1: due in Ses 2 |
|  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Reading in Branden and Tooze: {{< br >}}{{< br >}} \[BT\] Chapters 4 and 5: Alpha / Beta Structures and Beta Sheet Structures. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} As the protein structures considered get more complex, the information content of the chapter gets more densely packed with 3-D information. Give yourself additional time to examine and assimilate the images, particularly of the physiologically and enzymatically important barrels. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Paper to Read: {{< br >}}{{< br >}} O'Shea, Erin, Rheba Rutkowski, et al. "[Evidence that the Leucine Zipper is a Coiled Coil](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.2911757)." _Science_ 27, no. 4890 (1989): 538–42. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} This is not the paper reporting the X-ray structure of the GCN4 coiled coil, but its precursor. The methodology has subsequently been used for ongoing investigations of the sequence determinants of the coiled coil fold. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} 1.  Alpha / beta proteins represent a common structural motif, found among proteins with diverse enzymatic activities. Describe the relationship between the location of the active sites of these subclasses of alpha / beta proteins and their 3-D folds.{{< br >}}2.  1.  Describe the experimental evidence showing that the helical sequences studied in O'Shea et al are organized as parallel dimers.{{< br >}}    2.  Can you determine from the data presented whether monomers are α-helical? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  | Assignment 2: due in Ses 3 |
|  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Reading in Branden and Tooze: {{< br >}}{{< br >}} \[BT\] Chapter 15: Immunoglobulins. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} In considering the immunoglobulin fold on pages 303–05 look back to chapter 5 and compare with the γ-crystallin and jellyroll folds. The MHC structures on pages 315–20 have been considered by some as a model for how some chaperonins might recognize extended sequences. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Richardson, Jane S., and David C. Richardson. "[Amino Acid Preferences for Specific Locations at the Ends of α Helices](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.3381086)." _Science_ 240, no. 4859 (1988): 1648–52. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} S., Marqusee, Baldwin R.
